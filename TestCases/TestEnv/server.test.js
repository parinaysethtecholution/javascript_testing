1. Separate concerns by creating modular code structure:
   - Move API-specific logic (e.g., API endpoint URLs, API key handling) into separate modules or services.
   - Organize the code into appropriate directories (e.g., routes, controllers, services).

2. Enhance error handling:
   - Provide more detailed error messages to the client, including information about the specific error that occurred.
   - Consider using a centralized error handling middleware to handle and log errors consistently.

3. Improve code readability and organization:
   - Use more descriptive variable and function names.
   - Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code.
   - Adhere to a consistent code style (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide).

4. Implement input validation:
   - Validate the request parameters (e.g., query parameters) to ensure they are in the expected format.
   - Handle edge cases, such as missing or invalid input, and provide appropriate responses.

5. Enhance testability:
   - Separate the business logic from the Express.js-specific code to make it easier to write unit tests.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest to write comprehensive unit tests for the application.
