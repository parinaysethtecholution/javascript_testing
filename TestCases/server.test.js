1. Separate concerns by creating modular code structure:
   - Move API-specific logic (e.g., API endpoint URLs, API key handling) into separate modules or services.
   - Organize the code into appropriate directories (e.g., routes, controllers, services).

2. Enhance error handling:
   - Provide more detailed error messages to the client, including information about the specific error that occurred.
   - Consider using a centralized error handling middleware to handle and log errors consistently.

3. Improve code readability and organization:
   - Use more descriptive variable and function names.
   - Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code.
   - Adhere to a consistent code style (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide).

4. Implement input validation:
   - Validate the request body and query parameters to ensure data integrity and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

5. Add unit tests using a testing framework like Jest:
   - Write tests for the API endpoint handlers to ensure they function as expected and handle errors correctly.
   - Consider adding integration tests to verify the overall application behavior.
