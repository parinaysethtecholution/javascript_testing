1. Separate concerns: Consider separating the API endpoint handling logic into separate modules or functions to improve code organization and readability.
2. Error handling: Enhance the error handling by providing more detailed error messages and considering different types of errors (e.g., API response errors, invalid input, etc.).
3. Configuration management: Move the API key and other configuration values to a separate configuration file or environment variables to improve security and maintainability.
4. Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to help with debugging and monitoring the application.
5. Middleware usage: Evaluate the necessity of using the `cors` middleware and consider optimizing its configuration based on your specific requirements.
6. Asynchronous handling: Refactor the asynchronous code to use modern JavaScript features like `async/await` for better readability and error handling.
7. Code formatting: Ensure the code adheres to a consistent code style (e.g., Airbnb style guide) to improve code readability and maintainability.
